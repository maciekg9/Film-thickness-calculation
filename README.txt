BOTH POLYMER AND SOLVENT FILES HAVE A FIXED ORDER, THE APPLICATION READS EACH FILE LINE AFTER LINE.

The following applies to the polymer used to prepare the film:
temperature [K],
equilibrium solvent mass fraction [-],
ideal gas constant [atm * cm3 / (mol * K)],
kinematic viscosity of gas phase[cm2/s],
constant that depends on the gas phase Schmidt number[-].

The following applies to the solvent used to prepare the film:
initial solution density [g/cm3],
slovent molecular weight [g/mol],
vapor pressure of solvent[atm],
binary diffusivity of the solvent in the gas. [cm2/s].
